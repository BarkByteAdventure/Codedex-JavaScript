/*Create a JavaScript program that displays your initials in block letters.

First, start your program with a comment (single line or multi-line) that says a fun fact about yourself.

Then, create your block letters with your initials.

For example, if your name is Billie Eilish, your initials would be BE, and your block letters would look like this:

BBBB    EEEEE
B   B   E
B   B   E
BBBB    EEEE
B   B   E
B   B   E
BBBB    EEEEE
