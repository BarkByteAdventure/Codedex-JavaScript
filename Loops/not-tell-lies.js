//Iterators in Loops

- "iterate" means to run the code in a loop once
- When the i iterator variable has reached a value that sets
  the loop's condition to false, we can successfully exit the loop! */

- First, we define an i iterator variable with an initialValue.
- Before the first or next iteration, we test the i variable in the condition statement. 
  If we get true, we run the code. Otherwise, we exit the loop.
- After each iteration, we updateIterator and change the value of i.

/*
- let i = 1: initializes an iterator variable.
- i <= 10: the conditional statement that is tested before each iteration.
- i++: this increments the iterator variable by 1 after each iteration.
